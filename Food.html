        <p>
          Litti is a round wheat flour ball stuffed with sattu (roasted gram flour), seasoned with mustard oil, garlic, ginger, ajwain, green chilies, lemon juice, and various local spices. The dough balls are traditionally baked over cow dung cakes or coal fire, giving them a smoky flavor. After cooking, they are usually dipped in ghee (clarified butter) to enhance the taste.
          Chokha is a mashed vegetable preparation made from roasted eggplant (baingan), boiled potatoes (aloo), or tomatoes (tamatar) mixed with raw mustard oil, garlic, green chilies, onion, and fresh coriander leaves. It adds a soft, tangy, spicy balance to the dry, nutty flavor of litti.

The curry is lightly spiced, allowing the sourness to shine through, and is often tempered with mustard seeds, fenugreek, and green chilies. Masor Tenga is traditionally served with hot steamed rice and is especially preferred during the summer months as it aids digestion and has a cooling effect.

The result is a creamy, vibrant orange curry with a balance of heat and acidity. Goan fish curry is usually served hot with steamed rice, making it a comforting and aromatic meal that reflects the tropical richness of Goa's coastal kitchens.

Served with green chutney or sweet tamarind chutney, dhokla is not only a beloved breakfast or snack but also a symbol of Gujarat’s love for healthy, flavorful, and vegetarian cuisine.

It is often served with a dollop of ghee, curd, or lassi, making it a wholesome and filling meal. Bajre Ki Khichdi is not only a staple winter dish but also reflects the resourceful cooking style of Rajasthani cuisine, which makes the best use of local grains and simple ingredients.

Jadoh is a traditional and much-loved dish from Meghalaya, particularly among the Khasi tribe. The word "Jadoh" comes from two Khasi words: 'Ja' meaning rice and 'Doh' meaning meat. It is essentially a meat and rice dish, similar in appearance to biryani but with its own unique flavor and preparation style. The rice is usually cooked with pork, though chicken or other meats can also be used, and it is seasoned with turmeric, black pepper, ginger, onions, and sometimes local herbs to enhance the flavor. The distinctive reddish-yellow color of Jadoh often comes from turmeric or occasionally local fermented ingredients. Some variations include Jadoh Snam, which uses pork blood for a deeper, richer taste. Jadoh is traditionally enjoyed with pickles, salad, or chutneys and represents the warmth and hospitality of Khasi cuisine, making it a staple during festivals, family gatherings, and everyday meals.

           Phagshapa is a beloved traditional dish from Sikkim, especially popular among the Bhutia and Lepcha communities. It is a simple yet flavorful pork-based dish known for its hearty, comforting nature. The dish primarily consists of strips of pork fat and lean meat that are boiled and then sautéed with dry red chilies, radish (or sometimes turnip), and ginger-garlic paste, all simmered together without any oil. One of the highlights of Phagshapa is that it’s typically spice-rich but not oily, making it a healthier meat dish. The use of fermented ingredients or local pickled flavors sometimes enhances the taste further. The pork fat melts during cooking, enriching the stew-like base, while the radish adds a sharp, refreshing balance. Phagshapa is typically served hot with steamed rice and is enjoyed for its deep, warming flavors, especially during the colder months in the mountainous regions of Sikkim.

In Madhya Pradesh, it’s famously served with jalebi, creating a sweet-savory combination enjoyed with tea in the mornings. Poha is quick to prepare, easily digestible, and widely considered a wholesome and budget-friendly meal that suits all ages.

Made from wheat flour dough, Siddu is typically stuffed with a savory filling of spiced lentils (usually urad dal), crushed dry fruits, green chilies, and herbs, though variations also include poppy seeds or paneer. The dough is partially leavened using yeast, which gives it a soft and fluffy texture after steaming. Once the filling is enclosed within the dough, the Siddu is steamed until perfectly cooked, resulting in a warm, dense bread with a mildly fermented flavor.

The kebabs are so soft that they are traditionally eaten without the need for chewing — a feature that made them famous, as they were originally created for a nawab who had lost his teeth. The word "Tunday" refers to the one-armed chef, Haji Murad Ali, who popularized the dish in the 17th century under the patronage of the Nawabs of Lucknow.

Often served with raita and mirchi ka salan, Hyderabadi Biryani isn’t just a meal—it’s an experience that reflects centuries of culinary evolution and royal heritage.

          <h3>Jadoh (Meghalaya)</h3>
          <p>
Jadoh is a traditional and much-loved dish from Meghalaya, particularly among the Khasi tribe. The word "Jadoh" comes from two Khasi words: 'Ja' meaning rice and 'Doh' meaning meat. It is essentially a meat and rice dish, similar in appearance to biryani but with its own unique flavor and preparation style. The rice is usually cooked with pork, though chicken or other meats can also be used, and it is seasoned with turmeric, black pepper, ginger, onions, and sometimes local herbs to enhance the flavor. The distinctive reddish-yellow color of Jadoh often comes from turmeric or occasionally local fermented ingredients. Some variations include Jadoh Snam, which uses pork blood for a deeper, richer taste. Jadoh is traditionally enjoyed with pickles, salad, or chutneys and represents the warmth and hospitality of Khasi cuisine, making it a staple during festivals, family gatherings, and everyday meals.

          <p>
           
Mui Borok is the traditional cuisine of Tripura, and the term broadly refers to the tribal food culture of the state, with a deep emphasis on natural, healthy, and fermented ingredients. A signature element in Mui Borok is Berma, a type of dried and fermented fish that is central to many dishes and is used without oil, giving the food a distinctive umami flavor. Mui Borok includes dishes prepared with fresh vegetables, bamboo shoots, green papaya, rice flour, and meats like pork or chicken, all lightly spiced and often steamed or boiled to retain nutrients. The cuisine avoids excess oil and artificial additives, focusing instead on earthy, rustic flavors. Meals often include wahan mosdeng (spicy pork chutney), bangui rice, and sidal chutney, offering a wholesome and aromatic experience. Mui Borok represents the deep-rooted tribal traditions of Tripura and reflects their bond with nature and sustainable living through food.

          <h3>Phagshapa (Sikkim)</h3>
          <p>
           Phagshapa is a beloved traditional dish from Sikkim, especially popular among the Bhutia and Lepcha communities. It is a simple yet flavorful pork-based dish known for its hearty, comforting nature. The dish primarily consists of strips of pork fat and lean meat that are boiled and then sautéed with dry red chilies, radish (or sometimes turnip), and ginger-garlic paste, all simmered together without any oil. One of the highlights of Phagshapa is that it’s typically spice-rich but not oily, making it a healthier meat dish. The use of fermented ingredients or local pickled flavors sometimes enhances the taste further. The pork fat melts during cooking, enriching the stew-like base, while the radish adds a sharp, refreshing balance. Phagshapa is typically served hot with steamed rice and is enjoyed for its deep, warming flavors, especially during the colder months in the mountainous regions of Sikkim.

          <p>
           Poha is a light and nutritious breakfast dish that originates from Madhya Pradesh and is widely loved across central and western India.

Poha is typically prepared by rinsing the rice flakes and then sautéing them with mustard seeds, turmeric, green chilies, onions, and sometimes potatoes or peas, giving it both color and flavor. A touch of lemon juice and fresh coriander leaves is added at the end for freshness, and it is often topped with sev (crispy chickpea noodles) and roasted peanuts for crunch. In Madhya Pradesh, it’s famously served with jalebi, creating a sweet-savory combination enjoyed with tea in the mornings. Poha is quick to prepare, easily digestible, and widely considered a wholesome and budget-friendly meal that suits all ages.

          <p>
          Siddu is a traditional steamed bread delicacy from the Himachal Pradesh region, especially popular in the colder districts like Kullu, Manali, and Shimla. Made from wheat flour dough, Siddu is typically stuffed with a savory filling of spiced lentils (usually urad dal), crushed dry fruits, green chilies, and herbs, though variations also include poppy seeds or paneer. The dough is partially leavened using yeast, which gives it a soft and fluffy texture after steaming. Once the filling is enclosed within the dough, the Siddu is steamed until perfectly cooked, resulting in a warm, dense bread with a mildly fermented flavor.

           Thekua is a traditional sweet snack from Bihar, widely associated with festivals, especially Chhath Puja. This deep-fried delicacy is made using a simple mixture of wheat flour, jaggery (or sugar), and ghee, sometimes flavored with cardamom and fennel seeds for added aroma. The dough is kneaded into small flat discs or molded with traditional wooden molds to create intricate patterns, then deep-fried until golden brown. Once cooked, the outside becomes crisp while the inside remains slightly soft and grainy due to the jaggery.

          <h3>Tunday Kabab / Aloo Kachori (Uttarpradesh)</h3>
          <p>
           Tunday Kabab is a legendary culinary gem from Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, and a celebrated symbol of Awadhi cuisine. These melt-in-the-mouth kebabs are made from finely minced buffalo or mutton meat and a secret blend of over 100 aromatic spices, some of which are extremely rare. The kebabs are so soft that they are traditionally eaten without the need for chewing — a feature that made them famous, as they were originally created for a nawab who had lost his teeth. The word "Tunday" refers to the one-armed chef, Haji Murad Ali, who popularized the dish in the 17th century under the patronage of the Nawabs of Lucknow.
